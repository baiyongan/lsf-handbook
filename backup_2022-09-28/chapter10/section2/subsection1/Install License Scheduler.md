# Install License Scheduler

1. Perform the pre-installation steps.

2. Choose an installation plan:

   - UNIX: License Scheduler manages licenses for jobs that run through LSF and through applications other than LSF.

   - Windows, in a mixed cluster:

     A Licenser Scheduler installation requires UNIX hosts to run the **bld**. Windows hosts in a mixed cluster can run License Scheduler commands.

     When you have License Scheduler UNIX hosts working with LSF, run License Scheduler on Windows hosts as well.

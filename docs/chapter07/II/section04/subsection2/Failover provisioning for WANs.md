# Failover provisioning for WANs

Similar to LANs, you can configure your site for a failover mechanism across multiple sites in a wide network.

You need only one host to run License Scheduler, but you can configure your site for a failover mechanism with multiple candidate hosts to take over the scheduling in a failure.

License scheduling across sites can be streamlined because License Scheduler supports service provisioning during breaks in wide area network connections. This support means that you can run License Scheduler from one host that controls license scheduling across multiple sites.
